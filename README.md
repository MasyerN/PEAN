A crucial asset for deep learning in Whole Slide Image (WSI) diagnosis is pathologists’ expertise, which is commonly used in fully supervised learning through pixel-wise manual annotations. Although this method achieves higher performance than weakly supervised learning solely trained based on reported diagnostic results, the significantly manual labor of pathologists hampers efficacy to train fully supervised deep learning models. To efficiently leverage expertise of pathologists, achieve higher auxiliary diagnosis and reduce labor costs, we collected pathologists’ visual attention patterns captured by eye-tracking device to replace manual annotations. Subsequently, a Pathology Expertise Acquisition Network (PEAN) is designed, which extracts pathologists’ expertise from their visual patterns and leverages the expertise to identify subregions with high diagnostic value. In this study, 5,881 WSIs of skin lesion diagnosis are collected. Among them, 1,565 have both pathologists’ visual patterns and manual annotations for comparison. First, while comparing to manual annotation, collection of pathologists’ eye-tracking data reduces the average working time of pathologists from 14.2 minutes to 36.5 seconds. Second, driven by the pathological expertise extracted by PEAN, it achieved the best performance in the WSI five-classification tasks, with AUC of 0.984 and accuracy of 93.1%. Third, the WSI-reviewing behavior of pathologists was replicated, showing consistency with the pathologists themselves and statistically improving the diagnostic performance of existing deep learning models (p=0.005). Thus, this novel approach can replace labor-intensive manual annotations and lead to more accurate assisted diagnosis, which holds promise for future large-scale research applications.
